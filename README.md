# Cats vs Dogs ‚Äì Advanced Image Classification with CNN and VGG16

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and implementation of binary image classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a fine-tuned VGG16 model, trained on a balanced subset of 5000 images (cats and dogs) from the original Kaggle dataset.

## üß† Project Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of:

- A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- A fine-tuned transfer learning model using VGG16

Each model is trained, validated, and tested using carefully preprocessed image data. Evaluation is conducted with metrics such as Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC, Confusion Matrix, PR & ROC Curves, and visual misclassification analysis.

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebook

Launch the notebook and run all cells sequentially.

```bash
jupyter notebook Lab3_CNN_VGG16.ipynb
```

The notebook will:
- Auto-download the dataset and models if not found locally
- Train the models (or load saved ones)
- Generate evaluations, visualizations, and comparison tables

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy and Loss (Test Set)
- Confusion Matrix (Visual)
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- AUC (ROC Curve)
- Average Precision (PR Curve)
- Misclassified Image Visualization
- Comparison of Custom CNN vs. VGG16
- Correct/Wrong prediction overlap analysis

---

## üìå Key Highlights

- **Auto Resumable Pipelines:** Automatically downloads missing datasets and models
- **Model Checkpointing:** Uses `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and custom `BestModelSaver`
- **Transfer Learning Best Practices:** Phase-wise unfreezing with learning rate scheduling
- **Visual Debugging:** All failed predictions shown with ground truth and model label
- **Professional Code Structuring:** Markdown cells, plots, interpretations throughout

## üìä Performance Summary

| Model      | Accuracy | Loss   |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Custom CNN | 68.15%   | 0.6855 |
| VGG16      | 94.60%   | 0.2648 |

- VGG16 significantly outperforms the custom CNN in all evaluation metrics.
- ROC AUC and PR AUC both exceed 0.94, indicating strong binary discrimination.
- Misclassifications by the custom CNN were correctly predicted by VGG16 in 80%+ of cases.

---

## üîç Misclassification Insights

- The majority of errors by the custom CNN occurred due to overfitting and poor generalization.
- VGG16, after selective unfreezing of block5 layers, correctly handled complex edge cases.
- The visual heatmap and prediction overlays offer clear diagnostic value.
